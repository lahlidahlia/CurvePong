Right now this game is a pretty decent multiplayer game lacking a few necessary features

lacking features:
sound effects
mouse control
menu screen
AI controlled opponent
Resolution compatibility
Restyle the code - Update the code to my current style

I also plan to make this game into a breakout vs. game with the curveball mechanic.

But for now, probably mouse control first.

Relearning how the game project works:
It's been awhile since i've touched this project. I need to refresh myself on what makes the ball spins etc...

Mouse control:
why: 
 Because i'm not exactly confident in my AI making skill, the AI won't be a good simulation of a human's slow
keyboard movement. AI probably will have a basic following mechanic which will probably be similar to a 
human's mouse movement, so to keep things fair, it's probably better to give player the mouse too.
