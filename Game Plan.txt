Right now this game is a pretty decent multiplayer game lacking a few necessary features

--Stuffs-- = finished

lacking features:
--mouse control--
--Resolution compatibility--
menu screen
sound effects
AI controlled opponent
Restyle the code - Update the code to my current style
polish

I also plan to make this game into a breakout vs. game with the curveball mechanic.

But for now, polish this game first.



MOUSE CONTROL:
why: 
 Because i'm not exactly confident in my AI making skill, the AI won't be a good simulation of a human's slow
keyboard movement. AI probably will have a basic following mechanic which will probably be similar to a 
human's mouse movement, so to keep things fair, it's probably better to give player the mouse too.

RESOLUTION COMPATIBILITY
what:
 Right now the game would change when you start with different resolution. For example, the distance
between the two paddles would get shorter

why:
 The game shouldn't be change when you change resolution. 

status: abandoned 10/10/14
 Will just force the game to be played on 16:9 and 16:10. Too much work involved and this game probably 
won't be played on any other resolutions


MENU SCREEN: started 10/10/14
what:
 should have: an option button, a play button, a background, something to make it look prettier etc...
