Ball curviness: 10/6/14
 Unity physics engine is incredible. All it took to get the ball to spin (no curve though) was making a
physic2D material that had friction and bounciness (will experiment with these values) and place it on the
ball's circle collider. However, to get the ball to have the curve-in-the-air feel (think baseball pitching
or ping pong), I had to do:

rigidbody2D.AddForce(new Vector2(0, rigidbody2D.angularVelocity/250));

 That 250 is a magic number, and i'll have to test it to see what it does. I think it's a sensitivity 
setting. Never use magic numbers kiddies, they're bad.
 Basically this code is taking the ball's spinniness and giving the ball a push in the right direction. I 
don't completely understand the science behind it, but it works well so far.
